### Solar power and weather data ###

In this repository, solar power and weather data is updated daily for the specific location 
Worcester, GB. This data is publicly available in the public repository and will be available

Solar power data is generated from voltage and current sensors with an Arduino microcontroller 
board and it is recorded after each one minute interval and hourly weather data is updated using 
the Accuweather API. This repository also gets updates of daily weather data from Accuweather 
API since July 20, 2022.
